# Dungeons & Dragons 5E random character creator
Creates a random D&amp;D 5e Character as a JSON object

This is (eventually) going to be a website that will present the user with a random character sheet for D&D 5th edition.

Currently it is command line based.

##Testing
Running **node core.js** from the root directory will output a JSON formatted character sheet to the terminal

You copy and paste the output to a site such as [this](http://jsonviewer.stack.hu/) for better readability
